# ML-Internship-Project-Crop-Weed-Detection
An a machine learning project for my internship at UniConverge Technologies (UCT), focusing on building a computer vision model for crop and weed detection. The project uses the YOLOv8 model, trained on a custom dataset, to identify and classify crops and weeds in agricultural images.
